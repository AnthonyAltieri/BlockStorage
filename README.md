# BlockStorage
#### An open source self-hosted cloud storage solution with fault tolerance and upload/download optimization  
  
  
### Why this was built  
I began this project to familiarize myself with the Thrift framework but began to see the benefits of creating an open
source solution to cloud storage so I began adding features as my personal use warranted them. Personally I run this
storage server on a Rasberry Pi with a 128GB USB on my home network which allows me to keep an easy to manage distributed 
drive for all the computers in my home.
  
### Advantages
* Customizable -- You determine where your data is stored and by how many nodes
* Open Source -- Work with the community to build a better block storage solution
* Multi-platform -- Built with Python (with Thrift generating the RPC elements) so it runs almost everywhere
  
  
### Todos (features that need to be released):  
* End-to-end encryption
* Electron User-Interface
* Compression
* Phone Client

### Suggestions  
If you think of a feature that would be helpful to have for this service please open a ticket on the `Issues` tab with a
`questions` label on it and I'll promptly respond.  
  
  
##### Fork and play around with it for yourself!
